# diabetes-prediction
The successful completion of this project will result in a robust and interpretable 
machine learning model for diabetes risk prediction. This model can be integrated into 
healthcare systems, providing healthcare professionals with a valuable tool to identify at-risk 
individuals and tailor treatment plans accordingly.
Ultimately, our project aims to contribute to the advancement of healthcare by harnessing the 
potential of artificial intelligence to improve the lives of those affected by diabetes. By 
enhancing early diagnosis and personalized care, we aspire to reduce the impact of diabetes 
on individuals and communities.
